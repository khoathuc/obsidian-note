Oke, **show**(so) firstly we **gonna**(==are going to==) talk about garage salses, if you don't know what **is garage sales** (a garage sale is), this is an event where someone **sales**(==sell==) **all**(==old==) item **(that)** they don't use anymore, they **sale**(==sell==) these **item**(==items==) in their garage or **driveway**(==their driveway==). So the word "driveway" **refer**(==refers==) to the area of **..............**(==concrete==) **segments**(==cement==) outsite of your garage where you can park your car somethings in front of your house. So that's **(your)** driveway, and then the garage is the part **that**(==that's==) inside, you can close the garage door. So at garage **salse**(==sales==), people **sale**(==sell==) item from their ==garages==, out of their garage, or from the driveway. So **(other)** people come to their house, and they come on to the driveway or  into the garages and they look at these item that are for sale and they can buy those item. It's usually through ==the== cash so people pay you cash for these **item**(s). Cash just refer to dollars, coin **(s)**, bill **(s)**, not credit card. So they pay you in cash for items that you **(are)** selling. That's a garage sale. 

And this is an **insterting**(interesting) topic for many student **(s)** of mine in difference **country**(==countries==) beacause **(it's)** as far as i know from what they **('ve)** told me, garage sales  are **(aren;t)** really popular in other countries, they **('re')** actually  **non-existed**(nonexistent) in most **country**(countries). Garage sales are a uniquely americant ......**(phenomenon)**, in america we have a lot of garage sales, but in other **country**(countries) most people **havn't**(==have==) never seen one in their hole life so it's definitely in an american **phenomenon** so what do people **sale**(==sell==) **in**(at) grage sales in the US. A lot of things, really, people might sell clothes, they might sell **household, appliances**(==household applicanes==) like **..........,**(toasters) ==or== **blender** or things you use in the kitchen, appliances like that. Or they might sell old furniture: some old **chair**(s), **table**(s) .. things like that,  maybe toys, clothes, a lot of thing, really **anything** they **wanna**(want to) sell. Even old TV electronics, all kind of things. 

So why do american love garage sales so much. Well it's something that deeply **.........**(engrained) into **.........**(suburban) life, when i say the world **ingrain**(engrained) i'm saying that it has deep place in our culture, it's something that any american know well if they life in **the suburbs** or close to residential **area**(s) of the **citi**(es) at some point. I grew up in the **subburg**(suburbs) in houses, not partments, our house or our **neibor**(neightbors)... houses all has garages and driveways and front yard. The word yard refer to the area in fonrt of your house and behind your house. In america we have front yard, back **yard**(s), and side **yard**(s). And usually, the back yard is the biggest of the yards and it often has **garage**(grass) or maybe **(a)** even swimming pool add other things like .......**(patio)**, ...........**(bushed)** , a garden,... things like that. We call this a yard, in this case is a back yard. The front yard is the area in front of the house where the driveway is, and people usaully have **garage**(grass) and other things . 

So if you live in a house in the US, you usually have a front yard, because you have a front yard, you have space for people to come and shop if you have garage sale. In other **country**(countries), houses might not have this space in front of your house, it's just street . So people might not have the space to sale **item**(s) there and **customer**(s) don't have any space to look and browse through these items. The word browse just means to look through a collection. So if i'm in **(a)** store, and the worker **ask**(s) me if i'm looking for something in paritcular, i could just say "No, I amjust browsing" it means that i'm looking through their  **(of)** collection items. So american love garage sales because there usefull to help your **(get rid)** **all**(old) item and useful for **customer**(s) because you can often find very good **deal**(s) which means you can find good prices on **item**(s) because the owner just want to get .......**(rid)** of it, they want to throught it out, or sale it for very cheap, So often **times**, you can buy pretty usefful **thing**(s) for very little money. 

So american see garage sales very useful and it's also a fun activity for people to .......(**engage in**) I remember that when i was young, my family had **a garage sale** (garage sales). It was fun for me as a kid to sale my old toys, playing cards, .. things like that. I was really excited about earning money from other kid who wanted to buy my toys and it was an excinting expirence as a kid. But **it**()'s) also exciting to **go shop** and other **people**('s) garage sales ?? so with my family, when we would be driveing around on saturday and somehitng, and we would be see a sign that said garage sale, we would definitely go, we wold follow the sign and we would go to that garage sale and take a look around so many people do this, **they**('re) are already driving and they **gonna**(are goint to) go somewhere else and when they see a sign that said garage sale and they get excited and they decided to go to the sale and my family did that a lot when i was younger. Maybe this doesn't sound that exciting for you if you are not american and maybe you're thingking **.......**(I still) dont get why american like these garage sales so much, and maybe it's something cultural, maybe **it**('s') just somehitng that we've  always done and we like doing it and **this**(there's) really not a lot of reason why we love it so much, but we just comfortable with this type of selling and buying from other people, we like to look around and see what kind of cool thing people are selling, so owner might think it's not useful / **practical** for them so they wanna sell this, but i might think **it**('s) really cool, and i might really like it, so i can buy it from them, pretty cool thing in my opinion

American  usually dont have any problem with buying second-hand **item**(s). Second hadn item just means an an item that someone else has already used. So alot of american like buying these things, but i know that in other country people might not like this much, they might not trust these item, they might think a little weird to buy the item that are used, that other people've already used to. I dont have any problem buying second hand items, i actually like doing this because it save me money. In a merica you see many **..........**(==thrift store==) , **..........**(==thrift store==) is the store where they sell used **item**(s), usually used clothes and these are really popular in the US and i bought alot of clothes from **...........**(==thrift store==) store because i dont really care about fashion and i just want cheap usable close, so i used to buy clothes from ... pretty often when i need to buy new clothes

Okay, so firstly, we’re going to talk about garage sales. If you don’t know what a
garage sale is, this is an event where someone sells old items that they don’t use
anymore, and they sell these items in their garage or their driveway. So, the word
“driveway” refers to the area of concrete, cement, outside of your garage where you can
park your car sometimes in front of your house. So, that’s your driveway. And then the
garage is the part that’s inside, right, you can close the garage door. So, at garage
sales, people sell items from their ==garage==... or out of their garage, or from their driveway.
So, other people come to their house, and they come onto their driveway or into their
garage, and they look at the items that are for sale, and they can buy those items. It’s
usually through cash, so people pay you cash for these items. “Cash” just refers to
dollars, right, coins, bills... not credit cards, right. So they pay you in cash for items that
you’re selling. That’s a garage sale.
And this is an interesting topic for many students of mine in different countries,
because as far as I know, from what they’ve told me, garage sales aren’t really popular
in other countries. They’re actually nonexistent in most countries, right. Garage sales
are a uniquely American phenomenon, right. In America, we have a lot of garage sales,
but in other countries, most people have never seen one in their whole life. So it’s
definitely an American phenomenon. So what do people sell at garage sales in the US?
A lot of things, really. People might sell clothes, they might sell household appliances
like toasters or blenders or things you use in the kitchen... appliances like that. Or they
might sell old furniture: some old chairs or tables or things like that. Or maybe toys, you
know, clothes, a lot of things. Really, anything that they want to sell. Even old TVs,
electronics, all kinds of things.
So, why do Americans love garage sales so much? Well, it's something that's
deeply engrained into suburban life. When I say the word “engrained”, I'm saying that it
has a deep place in our culture, right, it's something that every American knows well, if
they lived in the suburbs or close to the residential areas of cities at some point. Right. I
grew up in the suburbs... in houses, not apartments. And our houses and our neighbors’
houses all had garages, and driveways, and front yards. The word “yard” refers to the
area in front of your house and behind your house. In America, we have front yards, and
back yards, and side yards. And usually, the back yard is the biggest of the yards, and it
often has grass or maybe even a swimming pool, and other things like a patio, bushes,
a garden, things like that. We call this a yard, and in this case, a backyard. The front
yard is the area in front of the house where you driveway is, and people usually have
grass and other things.
So, if you live in a house in the US, you usually have a front yard, and so
because you have a front yard, you have space for people to come and shop if you
have a garage sale, right. In other countries, houses might not have this space in front
of their house... it’s just the street, right. So people might not have the space to sell
items there and customers don’t have any space to look and browse through those
items. The word “browse” just means to look through a collection. So if I’m in a store,
and the worker asks me if I’m looking for something in particular, I could just say “No,
I’m just browsing... I’m just browsing around”. It means that I’m just looking through their
collection of items, right. So, Americans love garage sales because they're useful to
help you get rid of old items, and they're useful for customers because you can often
find very good deals, which means that you can find good prices on items because the
owner just wants to get rid of it. They want to throw it out or sell it for very cheap, so
often times, you can buy pretty useful things for very little money.
So, Americans see garage sales as very useful. And it's also a fun activity for
people to engage in. I remember that when I was young, my family had garage sales
and it was fun for me as a kid to sell my old toys and playing cards and things like that. I
got really excited about earning money from other kids who wanted to buy my toys, and
it was an exciting experience as a kid. But, it's also exciting to go shop at other people's
garage sales. So, with my family, when we would buy driving around on a Saturday or
something, and when we would see a sign that said Garage Sale, we would definitely
go. We would follow the sign, and we would go to that garage sale and take a look
around.
So, many people do this. They're already driving, and they're going to go
somewhere else, but when they see a sign that says Garage Sale, they get excited, and
they decide to go to the sale. And my family did that a lot when I was younger. Maybe

this doesn't sound that exciting for you if you're not American, and maybe you're
thinking, "I still don't get why Americans like these garage sales so much". And maybe
it's just something cultural, maybe it's just something that we've always done and we
like doing and there's really not a lot of reasons why we like it so much, but we're just
comfortable with this type of selling and buying from other people, and we like to look
around and see what kind of... or what kinds of cool things people are selling. So, the
owner might think it's not useful or practical for them, so they want to sell it. But I might
think it's really cool, and I might really like it, so I can buy it from them. It's a pretty cool
thing in my opinion.
Americans usually don't have any problem with buying second-hand items. A
"second-hand item" just means an item that someone else has already used. That's a
second-hand item. So, a lot of Americans like buying used things, second-hand items.
But I know that in other countries, people might not like this as much. They might not
trust the item, or they might think it's a little weird to buy items that are used... that other
people have already used. I don't have any problem buying second-hand items; I
actually like doing this because it saves me money. So, in America you see many thrift
stores. A "thrift store" is a store where they sell used items... usually used clothes. And
these are really popular in the US. And I've bought a lot of clothes from thrift stores
because I don't really care so much about fashion, and I just want cheap, usable
clothes. So, I used to buy clothes from thrift stores pretty often when I needed to buy
new clothes.
